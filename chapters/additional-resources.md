There are many resources out there to help you learn and master Vim. Here
are some of my favorites:

The book [*Practical Vim*](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Thought-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356980), by Drew Neil is truly great. I think it's
required reading if you really want to improve your Vim-fu. Drew also does
screencasts at http://www.vimcasts.org.

If you want to learn more about Vimscript check out [*Learn Vimscript the Hard Way*](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/), by Steve Losh.  It's a great resource for anyone that wants to
write Vim plugins.

I wrote a flashcard-style learning program for Vim called Vim Genius. You
can play it for free at http://www.vimgenius.com.

http://vim.wikia.com has quite a bit of information. You will surely come across
this site if you do any Googling about Vim.

Here is a great image of a keyboard overlaid with all the Vim commands and
their actions: http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif

And of course there's always StackOverflow, and your old buddy `:help`.
