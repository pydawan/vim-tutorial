# Plugins

I could write an entirely different guide just covering plugins, so I'm
just going to provide an overview of some of the most popular Vim plugins.


## Pathogen

Pathogen is a plugin manager for Vim. It automatically sources all of the
files that come with a plugin.

The instructions to setup Pathogen are located here:
https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

Once you have Pathogen installed, simply put your plugins in ~/.vim/bundle
to have them sourced.


## SuperTab

SuperTab  is a great plugin for text completion. Vim comes with text
completion built in, but SuperTab is much more intuitive -- you simply
press tab to autocomplete.

See: https://github.com/ervandew/supertab


## Vim Surround

Vim Surround provides mappings to easily add, modify, or delete characters
that surround words like (, [, ', and ".  This comes in handy all the time
when writing code.

See: https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround


## Eunuch

Eunuch.vim provides useful ex commands for Vim like :Remove and :Move.

## Rails.vim

If you're writing Rails apps with Vim then Rails.vim is indispensable. It
provides ex commands to help you quickly open the right file from anywhere
within your app.

## Vim Airline

Vim Airline makes your status line more useful. For example it changes
colors depending on what mode you are in. It's also highly configurable.

See: https://github.com/bling/vim-airline

## Tmux

Tmux isn't a Vim plugin, but it needs mentioning because it works so well
alongside Vim.

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer, meaning that it allows you to have multiple
terminal sessions running in one terminal window. It provides keystroke
mappings to open, close, and cycle through terminal windows. I highly recommend
checking it out if you want to improve your virtual workspace.

Tmux, like Vim, is highly configurable. Between Tmux and Vim, you may never
need to use your mouse again.  need your mouse anymore while coding.
