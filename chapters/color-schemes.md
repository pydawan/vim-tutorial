# Color Schemes

## Basic Usage

You have to like the look of your terminal if you're going to be in it all
day. Vim comes with quite a few color schemes. To see them:

1. Type :colo
2. Hit tab. You should see a list of available color schemes.
3. Type the name of the color scheme you want to try, then hit enter.

I am sort of a color scheme fanatic myself, and I eventually settled on two
color schemes that I like the most.


## Solarized

Solarized is a low contrast color scheme that's really easy on your eyes.
It's one of the most popular color schemes for Vim, for good reason. It has
a grey-blue background that might seem odd at first, but becomes really
pleasant once you spend some time with it.

## Molokai

Molokai is a fantastic color scheme. It has a dark background and vibrant
colors. It's my second favorite after Solarized.

## Others

Some other popular color schemes are Railscasts, Badwolf, Vividchalk,
Codeschool, and Pyte.
