You have to like the look of your terminal if you're going to be in it all
day. Vim comes with quite a few color schemes. To see them:

1. Type `:colo`
2. Hit `tab`. You will see a list of available color schemes.
3. Type the name of the color scheme you want to try, then hit `enter`.

I am a color scheme fanatic, but I eventually settled on two
color schemes that I like the most.

## Solarized

Solarized is a low contrast color scheme that's really easy on your eyes.
It's one of the most popular color schemes for Vim, and for good reason. It has
a blue-green background that might seem odd at first, but becomes really
pleasant once you spend some time with it.

## Molokai

Molokai has a dark background and vibrant colors. It's my second favorite after Solarized.

## Installing Color Schemes

To install a new color scheme just grab the `.vim` file that represents it and save it to `~/.vim/colors/`.

## Others

Some other popular color schemes are Railscasts, Badwolf, Vividchalk,
Codeschool, and Pyte.
