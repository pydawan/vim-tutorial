Welcome to my Vim Tutorial!

## How To Use this Tutorial

I've placed Javascript-simulated Vim boxes below each section so you can practice each new command.
 The only way you will remember all of these commands is to use them repeatedly, so spend some time playing and experimenting with each command you learn.

## Check out the Manual

Vim comes with an incredibly detailed built in manual. Just type `:help
<command>` to get all the information about a specific command. The manual will open
in a horizontal split. Type `:q<enter>` to close the manual.
