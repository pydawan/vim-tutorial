## How To Use this Tutorial

When you see a new command immediately practice it in this file. If it's a
command that changes something just hit u to undo. The only way you will
remember all of these commands is to use them repeatedly, so for each
command you learn, PLAY WITH IT. Experiment. See what it does and how it
behaves. It's easier to remember all of these commands than you might think
if you can integrate them into your muscle memmory.

## Check out the Manual

Vim comes with an incredibly detailed built in manual. Just type :help
<command> to get all the information about a command. The manual will open
in a horizontal split. Just type :q<enter> to close the manual.
