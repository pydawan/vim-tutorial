# Introduction

Vim is great for writing code, but what surpised me most about Vim is that
it's FUN. It's really exciting to see a whole paragraph disappear with 3
keys, or to play a macro that does a ton of work with with a single
keystroke.

Now that I know Vim I couldn't imagine writing code without it. I hope that
you will feel the same way once you become a Vim expert.

I created this tutorial for a few reasons. First I thought I could improve
upon existing tutorials by focusing on the commands and patterns that
programmers use most. Second, I wanted to teach people more about the
philosophy of Vim and how that relates to pleasant and speedy coding. Most
of all, I wanted to provide a thorough guide to Vim that will be useful to
both beginner and intermediate Vimmmers alike.


## How To Use this Tutorial

When you see a new command immediately practice it in this file. If it's a
command that changes something just hit u to undo. The only way you will
remember all of these commands is to use them repeatedly, so for each
command you learn, PLAY WITH IT. Experiment. See what it does and how it
behaves. It's easier to remember all of these commands than you might think
if you can integrate them into your muscle memmory.


## Check out the Manual

Vim comes with an incredibly detailed built in manual. Just type :help
<command> to get all the information about a command. The manual will open
in a horizontal split. Just type :q<enter> to close the manual.


Enough with the formalities, let's begin!
